## Running locally

1. Ensure Python (version 3.10 or above) is installed on the system.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment, in the same directory where the app's source is placed.
3. Once the environment is activated, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `python main.py` to start the backend (api) server.
5. Navigate to the `web` directory, and run ``npm install`` to install dependencies for the frontend.
6. Run ``npm serve`` to start the frontend server.
7. The app would be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
